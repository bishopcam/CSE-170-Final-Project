Interactive Traffic Simulation

Traffic and congestion phenomena belong to our everyday experience. In our simulation, you have the possibility to control traffic and create your own traffic jam. Find out how to trigger a traffic breakdown and how to resolve it. Observe how traffic jams can be seen as collective phenomena with waves propagating backwards from the bottleneck.
