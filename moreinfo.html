    <h6 class = "col s10 push-s1">This is a project to optimize the pedestrian crossings on the University of San Diego campus. The goal is to reduce the amount of time pedestrians spend waiting to cross the street. This is done by trying to find the best method for crossings, like pedestrian bridges, barriers in traditional crossings, tunnels, and more. </h6>
    <h6 class = "col s10 push-s1">This website is so you can explore the types of crossings, through a simulation and some comparison tools, and decide on what you would like on your campus. Feel free to also use the Suggestions page to send an email to the creators of the website to suggest new methods for street crossings on campus.</h6>
    <h6 class = "col s10 push-s1">This traffic simulation was not created by me, all credit to Martin Treiber, the github link to his project is here: <a href= https://github.com/movsim/traffic-simulation-de>HTML traffic simulator.</a> It also does not work perfectly with materialize, my style sheet, or really anything, therefore it does largely violate a lot of design principles. I tried my best to adapt the two given the html we learned in class but generally it was above my level so I would just like to acknowledge how it generally does not follow PARQ principles like contrast, consistency with color scheme, etc, because of my limited coding knowledge.</a></h6>
    <h6 class = "col s10 push-s1">I would also like to thank W3schools for much of the info on how to create some of the parts of the HTML and CSS that we did not learn in class.</h6>
